# Introduction to Python
by Alise Braick

### General Overview

This course will introduce students to Python programming. Students will learn how to program in the Python language, and they will become familiar with common computer science practices, such as variables, looping, condition statements, and lists, that can be applied to other programming languages. Student will have a chance to make simple projects such as a retirement calculator, dice guess game, and exercise trackerâ€¦etc 

### Motivation for Unit

I teach to 7th graders the game design unit of the CSD curriciulum/code.org. It is a javaSvript block-based languge that teach students the fundamental of computer programming. Nevertheless.  I believe that middle school students should learn a text programming languge before they enter high school. In the past I used p5 to expose 8th graders to text programming. However, when I have learned python this semester, I find it a better fit for my students for its simple syntax and semantics.  

### Standards Referenced

7-8.CT.6 // 9-12.CT.6: Algorithms and Programming (Design, compare and refine algorithms for a specific task or within a program. // Demonstrate how at least two classic algorithms work, and analyze the trade-offs related to two or more algorithms for completing the same task.)

7-8.CT.8 // 9-12.CT.8: Algorithms and Programming (Develop or remix a program that effectively combines one or more control structures for creative expression or to solve a problem. // Develop a program that effectively uses control structures in order to create a computer program for practical intent, personal expression, or to address a societal issue.)
